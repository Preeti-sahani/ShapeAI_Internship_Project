**About Github**

GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. ... GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a web interface to the Git code repository and management tools for collaboration. GitHub can be thought of as a serious social networking site for software developers.

# **Introduction**
This project is focused on exploratory data analysis, aka "EDA", which is essential part of the data science analysis pipeline. Also I have tried Scraping the repositories with different topics from github front page. I have used Python BeautifulSoup to scrape the data.

# **Requirements**
Google Colab.

Dataset (Taken from kaggle).

# **Objective of this analysis:**

  - Learning how to read and analyse a dataset.
  - To analyze top github stared, fork, repositories.
  - Understanding the dominant languages used for popular GitHub projects and mapping them.
  - Extracting the different domains of work done in these projects via the repositories tags.
